todo-backbone-rails
===================

Backbone's Todo app example with a Rails backend

This application has been modified to easily test
[Caliper](http://caliper.io).

When you run it up you simply enter your Caliper API key and use the
application, create some todo's, run some filters, refresh the page,
etc.

Visit your application in Caliper and you will then see the data
captured.
